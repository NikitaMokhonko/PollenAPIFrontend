# Pollen Forecast Website Frontend

Hi there!

This is the frontend part of my pollen forecast website project, made using **React** and **Tailwind**.

The website has 2 pages: **Home** and **About**. On the Home page, I have created **8 custom sprites** for different pollen values using **Photoshop**.

The pollen count values are gathered from my [backend](https://github.com/NikitaMokhonko/PollenAPIBackend).
